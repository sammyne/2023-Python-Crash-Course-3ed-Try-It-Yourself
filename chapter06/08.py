# 6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a differ-
# ent pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name.
# Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as
# you do, print everything you know about each pet.
