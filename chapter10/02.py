# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a
# string with a different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace
# 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'
# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and
# replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print
# each modified line to the screen.

from pathlib import Path

path = Path('data/learning_python.txt')
contents = path.read_text()

print('print line by line')
lines = contents.splitlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line.replace('Python','C'))
