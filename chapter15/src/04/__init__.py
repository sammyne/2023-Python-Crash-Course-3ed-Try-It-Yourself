# 15-4. Modified Random Walks: In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are
# generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly
# from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the
# values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try
# a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1
# from the x- or y-direction list.
