# 16-9. World Fires: In the resources for this chapter, youâ€™ll find a file called
# world_fires_1_day.csv. This file contains information about fires burning in differ-
# ent locations around the globe, including the latitude, longitude, and brightness
# of each fire. Using the data-processing work from the first part of this chapter
# and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which parts of
# the world are affected by fires.
# You can download more recent versions of this data at https://earthdata
# .nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data. You can
# find links to the data in CSV format in the SHP, KML, and TXT Files section.
