# 17-2. Active Discussions: Using the data from hn_submissions.py, make a bar
# chart showing the most active discussions currently happening on Hacker News.
# The height of each bar should correspond to the number of comments each sub-
# mission has. The label for each bar should include the submissionâ€™s title and act
# as a link to the discussion page for that submission. If you get a KeyError when
# creating a chart, use a try-except block to skip over the promotional posts.
